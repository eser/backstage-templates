## Installation

- 1️⃣ Ensure that `golang` tools are _properly_ installed on your machine

  ```bash
  $ go version
  go version go0.0.0 os/arch64

  $ go env GOPATH
  ~/go/0.0.0/packages
  ```

  **Important rules:**
  - `GOPATH` envvar must be set to output of `go env GOPATH`
  - `$GOPATH/bin` must be included to your `PATH` envvar

  So, your `~/.zprofile` should include something like this:

  ```
  export GOPATH="$(go env GOPATH)"
  export PATH="$PATH:$GOPATH/bin"
  ```


- 2️⃣ Install prerequisites
  - Install golangci-lint

  ```bash
  $ curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin
  golangci/golangci-lint info checking GitHub for latest tag
  golangci/golangci-lint info found version: 0.0.0 for v0.0.0/os/arch64
  golangci/golangci-lint info installed ~/go/0.0.0/packages/bin/golangci-lint
  ```

  - Install gcov2lcov

  ```bash
  $ go install github.com/jandelgado/gcov2lcov@latest
  ```

  - Install pre-commit

  ```bash
  $ brew install pre-commit
  ==> Fetching dependencies for pre-commit
  ==> Fetching pre-commit
  ==> Installing dependencies for pre-commit
  ==> Installing pre-commit
  ```

- 3️⃣ Ensure that you can access private dependencies

  You need to get a Personal Access Token from your GitHub account in order to
  download private dependencies.

  To get these, visit https://github.com/settings/tokens/new and create a new
  token with the `read:packages` scope.

  Then, you need to create or edit the `.netrc` file in your home directory with
  the following content:

  ```
  machine github.com login <your-github-username> password <your-github-access-token>
  ```

- 4️⃣ Download required modules for the project

  ```bash
  $ go mod download
  ```

- 5️⃣ Install pre-commit hooks

  ```bash
  $ pre-commit install
  ```
